Movie Trailer Website of my favorite movies!

This is my favorite movies list while open from an HTML file and stored in a server-side using Python.

You will need two things to see my project:
1. Install Python if not there is a html.file (movies.html) to see my list, but won't be able to see how it works on python.
2. Web browser to open the html.file

It is similar from the fresh tomatoes mini project. If you want to watch a trailer of a movie just simply click on the movie image.
I also added two new things: an age rate below the title and a short summary will pop up at the top of movie image when hovering over it.
